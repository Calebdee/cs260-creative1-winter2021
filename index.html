      <strong>Merriam-Webster Defines Milk as the Following:</strong>

      And that is exactly what we are selling! We believe that all people everywhere should be able to enjoy cow milk,
      even those who do not have their own lactating cow! This simple belief, forged over a livetime of love towards cows,
      has inspired us to create our own milk distribution service. We are planning on using the lasting in slow-speed transporation
      technology to ensure that we get our bottles to within just 21 working days!
    </p>
    <p id = "words">Our business is already thriving because we are committed to milk. Drinking it, churning it, cheesing it, you name, we love it.
      Milk truly is the miracle drink! The creator of this site isn't even joking, milk is great. There is a town in suburban Utah named Provo
      that practically lives off its chocolately variety. Whether you are Mitt Romney during the impeachment trial or a BYU student trying to drown
      their sorrows in a cold one, this drink is sure to hit the spot.</p>
